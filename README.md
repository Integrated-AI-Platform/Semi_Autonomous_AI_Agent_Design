# Semi_Autonomous_AI_Agent_Design

> Definition

A semi-autonomous AI agent refers to an artificial intelligence system that possesses a certain degree of autonomy and can perform tasks or make decisions independently to some extent but still requires human intervention or oversight in certain situations.

A semi-autonomous AI agent combines the capabilities of both autonomous and human-guided systems. It has the ability to operate and make decisions based on predefined rules, learned patterns, or algorithms, without the need for constant human involvement. It can analyze data, process information, and perform tasks in a self-directed manner.

However, unlike fully autonomous AI agents, which can operate completely independently without human intervention, semi-autonomous AI agents have certain limitations or boundaries where human control or input is required. These limitations may be in place for safety, ethical considerations, or complex decision-making scenarios that require human judgment.

The level of autonomy in a semi-autonomous AI agent can vary depending on the specific system and context. It is designed to strike a balance between the benefits of automation and the need for human oversight, ensuring that critical decisions are made with human involvement while allowing the agent to operate efficiently and independently in less critical or routine tasks.

> Design

1. Generate a data flow and assign the necessary tools to complete each step.
2. As the AI agent executes the data flow step-by-step, it can ask the human supervisor for additional guidance or data.
3. If the AI agent encounters a critical error, it halts the program, notifies the human supervisor, and makes necessary changes to the data flow.
4. Otherwise, the AI agent successfully executes the program and returns the summary of the event log to the human supervisor.
